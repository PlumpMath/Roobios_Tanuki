### Design

Since I lack all design skill or inspiration, I'm using [discordapp]()'s chat layout design as a starting point.

In a chat room there is a very slim leftmost toolbar, which opens up different servers.( Within each server there can be different rooms.)

Slightly larger column just to left holds voice and text channel selection for the active server.

There is the scrolling conversation log in the middle.

And on the far right there is a column showing what I call the 'hive'.  Shows who is online and active, possibly also may show members who aren't actively online/connected.
