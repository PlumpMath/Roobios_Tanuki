### flexbox-ikea-src


Source files folder for the flexbox-ikea version of the app as distinct from the SVG-all-the-Things version /app /endpoint whatever you want to call it.


For some reason Flexbox and maybe CSS generally reminds me of Ikea, so.

Need to name the svg one something other than src to differentiate them as parallel items of a set.
