### roobios-tanuki : what is it ?

This is an R&D platform for realtime web-apps. We are using nodejs, reactjs, primus (websocket abstraction layer), coffeescript, webpack.  It is the latest manifestation of the pattern I've been massaging, refactoring, perfecting, evolving etc for the last 5 years.  Realtime SPA (reactjs) with a websocket server (nodejs) hooked up to redis is the core of the pattern.

#### Purpose

This project started as I was in the process of learning [Elm](); I realised its affinity with my own pattern (fp architecture throughout), and it occurred to me that I should refactor it for comparison.

Elm looks good to me; systematized to enforce rather than merely allow fp patterns -- immutables and pure functions, and type safety.

The advantages of sticking with Javascript (coffeescript actually but closer JS than Elm is) are mainly in the full access to npm libraries.
