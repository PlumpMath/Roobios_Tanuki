_This is a work in progress ._

#### Purpose

Elm looks good, was remarking how much it resembles our CoffeeScript + React pattern, systematized to enforce rather than allow immutables and pure functions, and type safety. It's as though the pattern were optimised around a language that would enforce it, and type safety.  

All of this is nice, but maybe there are advantages to sticking within the Npm ecosystem in some cases.  At any rate, would be bad to completely neglect an old tool.  So maybe just optimising to leave it behind. Also though there may be advantages to working with Npm and whatever else.

So this will be to refactor that pattern for the blog website portfolio whatever use case.
