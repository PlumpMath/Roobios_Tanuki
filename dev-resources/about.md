###  some notes on roobios-tanuki, a react / coffeescript / nodejs / maybe websocket thing


- continued development of the SVG-all-the-Things pattern svgatth

- parallel development of flexbox modern but more traditional CSS layout patterns

- separate endpoints but could be merged into a single app if necessary

- looking into elm and doing this refactor as part of the process of learning and potentially migrating to Elm for future projects.

- potential exists for hybrid component systems in the web-browser, with source material coming from Elm, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, TypeScript, etc.

- open source repo on github, deploy some version to heroku

- sharpening this tool means moving more towards pure FP when appropriate (often), putting unit tests into same folder as the files they test as an organic BDD/TDD practice, emphatically not using any testing framework (mocha, chai, karma etc)
